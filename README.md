# Chatboot-Locallama
The goal of this project is to develop an intelligent chatbot application that runs entirely offline using Meta's LLaMA (Large Language Model) architecture. The chatbot is designed to simulate human-like conversations, answer queries, and perform tasks without relying on cloud APIs, ensuring data privacy and full local control.
